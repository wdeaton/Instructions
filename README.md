## Soxhlet Extraction

One time I had good instructions was the time I needed additional instructions on the use of Soxhlet Extraction. I was given verbal instructions but I still needed clarification. I found a source online that helped me immensely. The instructions helped me with visuals, examples, labels, and definitions. The visuals helped me 'see' what was going on, while the labels helped me understand the parts of the extractor. The definitions of the parts helped describe how each part works in the whole process. Then the instructions told me how to do the extraction while the examples helped illistrate the technique of extraction.
